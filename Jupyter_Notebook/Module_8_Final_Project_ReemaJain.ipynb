One of the reason may be due to pandemic.Excluding 2020, it looks like men & woman trend looks pretty similar except in year between 1997-1999. In this period, men's clothing dropped(~-5%) while women's clothing continued increasing at around 6%.\n",

Sales increase during holiday seasons i.e. sales starts increasing in Nov(Thankgiving) of every year & is at peak in December(Christmas,New Year etc.).Looking at rolling averages for 12 months, it looks like sales of jewelry is pretty stable. Sales of Paint and wallpaper is also seasonal driven. Sales peak during June-Aug. Rolling Average for 12 months shows an increasing trend for paint and wallpaper sales.\n"

One of the reason may be due to pandemic.Excluding 2020, it looks like men & women trend looks pretty similar except in year between 1997-1999. In this period, men's clothing dropped(~-5%) while women's clothing continued increasing at around 6%."
